1. Which issues were the easiest to fix, and which were the hardest? Why?
Easiest: The style-related issues from Flake8 and Pylint (like function names, line length, and spacing) were the easiest. They were mechanical changes that didn't require deep logical thinking.
Hardest: The global-statement issue was the most challenging. It wasn't just a one-line fix; it required refactoring the entire script's architecture to pass state through function arguments instead of relying on a global variable. This required careful thought about the flow of data through the program.
2. Did the static analysis tools report any false positives?
No, in this particular lab, all the issues reported by the tools were valid and pointed to genuine areas for improvement in code quality, security, or style.
3. How would you integrate static analysis tools into your actual software development workflow?
I would integrate them automatically using pre-commit hooks. This would run tools like Flake8 and Bandit on my code every time I try to make a Git commit. If any issues are found, the commit is blocked until they are fixed. For team projects, I would add a step to the Continuous Integration (CI) pipeline (e.g., GitHub Actions) to run a full Pylint analysis, ensuring that no low-quality code gets merged into the main branch.
4. What tangible improvements did you observe in the code quality, readability, or potential robustness after applying the fixes?
Robustness: The code is significantly more robust. The addition of input validation and specific exception handling means it no longer crashes on bad data or missing files.
Readability: The code is vastly more readable. The switch to standard snake_case names, the addition of comprehensive docstrings and type hints, and the improved formatting make it easy for another developer to understand the code's purpose and usage at a glance.
Maintainability: The removal of the global variable makes the code much easier to maintain and debug. Each function is now more self-contained, and the flow of data is explicit, reducing the chance of unintended side effects.
